This module focuses primerly on what is **user intreface** and what is the difference between that and **user experience**.

## User interface
An application is mainly built from __two main parts__: the **back-end** (which holds how the information is being changed in methods and in certain cases) and the **user interface** (that displays the information to the user). Of course, the database is a third part of an application but it is merely integrated in the back-end because it stores data.

User interface referrs (as the term is also suggesting) the interface of an application which the user interracts with - the visual part of the project.

## User experience
When considering creating an application, indifferent of the technology to-be-used, discussing User experience (UX) is definitely a must - this because every -thing that is developed a user will interact with and the outcome depends on howpleased is the user with the product
Often people confuse UI with UX - user experience - action that cannot be more wrong and this is why:
- When discussing user experience, people often think that it describes what the final product looks like, how easily specific lists or pages can be reached and especially how pleasing it is to the user;
- That is what the "user interface" (UI) term means, whereas User experience involves user the interface but doesn’t  consist  only  from  this,  just  like  a  final product doesn’t consist of only the front-end part of the application.
  - User experience applies mainly to a person’s endangerment using a product, this consisting of both the user interface but more importantly of the performances of the application, how adaptable it is to _big data_ but also which _environment variables are relevant_ and which are not.

### UX vs UI
The following parallel describes what elements create the user experience and what can be derived from the user interface, also explaining the difference between these two concepts.

As you can see, all the _business analysis_, _user researchability_ and various discovered _scenarios_ come around togheter and define User experience, whereas from the User interfaces can be understood and pointed out elements such as the _visual design_ - how the application is suppose to look like, the _colors_ and _layouts_ (about which we will be talk about in a further module) and what the _graphic designers' work_ is combined for.

#### If you are still not sure what is the difference, then please see the bellow real scenario that explains the difference:
